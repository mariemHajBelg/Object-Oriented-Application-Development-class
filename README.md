# Object-Oriented-Application-Development-class
This course teaches object-oriented programming and development using the Java programming language. It allows students to complete several programming assignments designed to reinforce their comprehension of object-oriented concepts, including encapsulation, class hierarchies and polymorphism. Developing both Java applications and applets aims at strengthening their understanding of abstract classes and interfaces, event-driven programming and exception handling.
